# ginhom(r) is the probability of observing a pair of points at certain locations
# separated by a distance r, divided by the corresponding probability
# for a Poisson process of the same (inhomogeneous) intensity
# The inhomogeneous pair correlation function is currently computed by calling Kinhom followed
# by pcf.fv (which does numerical differentiation):
# pag. 94 ,
# This is a non-centred correlation which may
# take any nonnegative value. The value g(r) = 1 corresponds to complete randomness; for the
# Poisson process the pair correlation is gpois(r) â‰¡ 1. For other processes, values g(r) > 1 suggest
# clustering or attraction at distance r, while values g(r) < 1 suggest inhibition or regularity.
